Why Way prediction can optimize Cache Performance?
=====

### What is Way Prediction?
We know that direct-mapped caches are better than set-associative caches in terms of the cache hit time but set-associative cache has higher hit rates. We want to combine the benefit of direct-mapped caches and set-associative ones and the way prediction come out for this reason. Let's take the two-way set-associative cache for example. Each set  of this cache has two ways(two lines) in it. By doing way prediction, we are effectively using one line of these at first. Only if we don't find it there, we look at the other one. So effectively, a way prediction cache first tries to access what looks like a smaller direct-mapped cahce then it will try the entire set-associative cache.
